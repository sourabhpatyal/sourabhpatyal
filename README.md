## 👋 Hello, World!

I'm **Sourabh Patyal**, an **Embedded Systems Engineer** and **Technical Trainer** from 🇮🇳 India.  
With a passion for **bare-metal logic** and a mission to **mentor future engineers**, I dive deep into **microcontroller programming**, **hardware protocols**, and **system-level design**.

> 🧠 *“I don’t just blink LEDs — I light up understanding.”*

## ⚙️ My Embedded DNA

- 🛠️ **Bare-metal C** – No HAL, no layers — just you and the silicon  
- 🧾 **Datasheet Diver** – Registers don’t scare me, they guide me  
- ⚡ **Bitwise Thinker** – Every bit has a story  
- 🧵 **Interrupt Sculptor** – Precision ISR designs  
- 🧠 **Debugging Mentor** – Find it. Fix it. Learn it.
